# Teacher-School Matching with Random Forest Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-based platform to match teachers with schools. It uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict the suitability of teacher-school pairings based on various attributes and feedback ratings. The project includes generating synthetic data, training the model, and testing the matching predictions.
